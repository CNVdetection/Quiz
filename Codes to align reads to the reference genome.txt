# bam files are consequently sorted and indexed

Then I used Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) to visualize bam files of bliss and restseq.
Visualized data show that bliss is a very low-coverage sequencing data of the whole genome, in which reads are almost uniformly distributed along human chromosomes. 
In restseq, as I had envisaged before, sequencing machine has targeted some special regions of the genome for sequencing and no reads are generated from other genomic regions.
However, in restseq, a higher number of reads are generated from those targeted regions, compared to the average genome-wide sequencing coverage in bliss.
To call those regions with Double Strand Breaks (DSBs), I'm in the process of analyzing bam files. 
To call these variants, I have to know the expected potential abnormalities in the reads, after mapping them to the reference genome.
My speculation is that observing more indels is expected, in the vicinity of DSBs.
